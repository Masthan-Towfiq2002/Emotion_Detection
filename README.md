# Emotion Detection

This project is an implementation of emotion detection using machine learning techniques. The implementation is based on the `Implementation.ipynb` file.

## Overview

The project uses a dataset of facial expressions to train a machine learning model to detect emotions. The model is then used to predict the emotions of new images.

## Requirements

To run the project, you will need the following:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- OpenCV

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Implementation.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to train the model and make predictions.

## Credits

The dataset used in this project is the [FER-2013 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data) from Kaggle.
